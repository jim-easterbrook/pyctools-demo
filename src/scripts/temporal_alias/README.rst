Temporal aliasing
=================

This demonstration shows how one spatio-temporal frequency can represent (at least) two different moving objects.
It's analogous to the well known wagon wheels going backwards effect often seen in old westerns.

It's also a good test of your computer's "tear free" (or similar) settings and how well pyctools can synchronise with the display.

Stage 1
-------

This shows a set of vertical bars moving horizontally.
(Opening the zone plate generator config will show the actual frequencies.)
The pattern may just look like some flickering bars at first, but if you let your eye track from left to right you may see the motion.
Pausing the display shows the vertical bars more clearly.
They could be part of a picket fence or some other object with a similar repeating structure.

Stage 2
-------

Adding lower spatial frequency bars moving from left to right makes the motion a lot more apparent.
This might be fence posts in a real scene.

Stage 3
-------

Some faster moving bars, travelling from right to left, are also in sync with the main image!
Try to track the upper bars and you'll see this.
You may also notice that the bars look a lot more blurred when you do this.
This is because the long temporal aperture of most flat panel displays holds the image for a significant period of time, during which your tracking eye moves, smearing the image.
A traditional CRT display should look a lot sharper.
