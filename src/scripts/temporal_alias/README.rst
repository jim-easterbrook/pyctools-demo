Temporal aliasing
=================

This demonstration shows how one spatio-temporal frequency can represent (at least) two different moving objects.
It's analogous to the well known wagon wheels going backwards effect often seen in old westerns.

It's also a good test of your computer's "tear free" (or similar) settings and how well pyctools can synchronise with the display.

Stage 1
-------

This shows a set of vertical bars moving from left to right.
(Opening the zone plate generator config will show the actual frequencies.)

Stage 2
-------

Adding lower spatial frequency bars moving from left to right confirms what sort of motion the main image represents.

Stage 3
-------

Some faster moving bars, travelling from right to left, are also in synch with the main image!
Try to track the upper bars and you'll see this.
You may also notice that the centre image looks a lot more blurred when you do this.
This is because the long temporal aperture of most flat panel displays holds the image for a significant period of time, during which your tracking eye moves, smearing the image.
