Lecture
=======

About a year after I retired from `BBC R&D`_ I volunteered to give a "lunch time lecture" about my Pyctools project.
This folder contains my "slides" in LibreOffice Impress format and exported to PDF.
They give a brief background to the development and highlight a few of the things I've considered when writing Pyctools.

The demonstrations referred to are available in the src/scripts dorectory.
